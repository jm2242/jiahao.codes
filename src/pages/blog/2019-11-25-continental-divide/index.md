My father and I decided to up our game this year and try a longer and more intense motorcycle trip. We had our sights on the Continental Divide after watching videos of the beautiful landscape out west.

We deliberated for a long time whether we would ship the bikes, haul the bikes, or rent bikes there. Ultimately we decided that the shipping was expensive enough that it would be worth buying a trailer and just trailer them out. Since I had free time after the trip, I would be able to haul them back on my own. I'm not sure which option would have been better in the end, but at least we now have an additional Kendon motorcycle trailer that works very well and is easily hauled.

# Day 1 - NY to Ohio

After final packing preparations and loading the bikes on to the trailer, we left Tarrytown at 12. A few hours into the drive, a bunch of lights illuminate on the dash - the Check Engine light, tracking control, VSC. With over two thousand miles to go, this was not a good sign. I immediately turned to Google and Youtube and we based on some videos we suspected it was the gas cap. A quick trip to Autozone and a 30 minute drive later, all the lights went out! This ended up being the only real issue with the truck the entire trip, which was a blessing! We found a hotel in Toledo and took some rest for the night.

We woke up and left Toledo. Today we drove from 9AM till about midnight, including a time change. 16 hours and something like 840 miles. We made it to Fargo, South Dakota. Not much else to report about today.

Another full day of driving. We made it to Great Falls late, around 10PM. What a relief to finish 33 hours of driving! We slipped into the hot tub at our hotel to decompress which felt great.

The bikes were still attached, but a few tie downs had started to wear and the license plate almost fell off the trailer! This was my fault because I had only attached it with one screw. Luckily, I zip tied one end which prevented it from falling off completely.

After waking up, we drove out to the storage facility in Great Falls. A woman greeted us from her trailer which smelt very questionable. There we packed the bikes, parked the truck and trailer into the unit, and departed north towards Glacier National Park.

As we were packing, I thought to myself, wow, I took way too much stuff. It was difficult to find a home for everything. Let this be a lesson - too much stuff can be more of a burden than a few missing items. As a consequence, Dad also got mad at me for taking way too long to get ready. Sorry Dad.

The drive today was rather boring - mostly flat, plains like terrain with very few notable features along the way. We arrived in the Glacier late afternoon hoping to ride the Going to the Sun road, but we decided against it for today as it was already too late. We spent the night at a KOA with a great hot tub.

# Day 5 -

We left the campsight around 10AM. For Dad this was way too late - if it was up to him we would be packed and riding by 830. However, I take too long to get ready and so Dad has to put up with this (again, sorry Dad). Today we drove the Going to the Sun road which was very nice. The weather was fantastic - we were super lucky to get great views of the park. We didn't stop for any hikes as we were did not budget for additional time in the park.

Weather was great too which was lucky for us. We stopped a few times to look at views but did not do any hikes as we didnt budget the time for it and we have no place to store our gear. After leaving the park, wedrove down to Columbia falls to start the GCD. From there we took a variety of Backcountry paved and unpaved roads until we got to some mountain Jeep road. We ended today by finding some random bed and. Reakfast which had an amazing restaurant. Thexowner is the chef I think, but the good was delicious. She was also kind of a personality. She told us that we absolutely needed to mount the bear spray on the bikes and how to use it as well

Last day of the trip! The bikes are stored in the storage unit for me to pick up in a few weeks with the truck on the way home. Dad flies home, and I fly back to Great Falls, MT to start the next phase of my trip on my own!
